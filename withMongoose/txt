we can connect with mongodb directly through our NODE app 

there are 2 ways to communicate with a database,

one is through the database's own query language like sql 
--another is to write orm's that is representing the connection strings through object models in javascript 

query langauge is often much faster than odm's because odm use transition code to map between objects and the database
